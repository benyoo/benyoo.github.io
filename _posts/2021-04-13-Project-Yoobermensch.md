Project Yoobermensch is simple. It is the approach of learning mulpitle new skills by tackling them simultaneously, switching between projects when stuck in order to maintain momentum. This fully embraces the ADHD brain that I have. Yoobermensch is the second iteration of what started out as Project Ubermensch.
